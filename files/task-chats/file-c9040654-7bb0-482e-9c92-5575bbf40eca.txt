3- the head of the table is ideally closer to the wall with anesthesia access, the table’s position should also leave enough space from the door, typically at least 2 meters (6-7 feet), so personnel can enter and exit smoothly without disturbing the sterile field around the patient.

4- Guideline Recommendations for Cardiac Operating Rooms:
The Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) and International Health Facility Guidelines (iHFG) both suggest a vertical layout with the head of the table near a wall with anesthesia support outlets and equipment. This layout is generally recommended for cardiac procedures to optimize access and workflow.
Clearance Recommendations: Maintain at least 3-4 feet (1-1.2 meters) of clearance around the sides of the table and 6-8 feet (1.8-2.4 meters) from the head to the door for unimpeded access to the patient and equipment.

5- Horizontal Table: The head of the table should be positioned opposite the door, allowing surgical staff to have a clear line of sight and access to the patient without obstruction. This setup allows the anesthesiologist and other medical staff to stand at the head of the table while the surgical team works around the patient.

Vertical Table: In cases where a vertical table is used (such as for certain types of minimally invasive surgeries), the head might also be oriented opposite the door, but the patient's position may be more inclined. This setup still ensures that staff can move freely and access the patient, while the table’s angle helps facilitate the specific surgery being performed.
